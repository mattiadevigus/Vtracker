<h2>&#128308 Vtracker: a simple tracker for ACC's servers</h2>
<h3>How does it works?</h3>
<p>&#128302 It was designed to read the data of each session carried out on a ACC server with a pleasant and easy to view interface</p>
<h3>It offers:</h3>
<ul>
  <li>&#128202 A timetable containing the best overall times of each session</li>
  <li>&#128200 Iteractive graphs</li>
  <li>&#128736 Config Area (future release)</li>
</ul>
<h3>Preliminaries</h3>
<ul>
  <li>&#128064 You obviously need a ACC server. You will not think of using the Vtracker without a server XD</li>
  <li>&#10071 You must first enable the function of saving session data in the results folder. To do this, follow the tutorial on https://www.acc-wiki.info/wiki/Server_Configuration#Result_Files</li>
  <li>&#127744 To access your app, you can use localhost if you log in from the same computer, otherwise use public ip</li>
</ul>
<h3>Installation on Windows:</h3>
<ul>
  <li>&#127758 Download the zip and extract it</li>
  <li>&#128736 Open the "config.json" file and enter the file path of the results folder and the port of your choice for the server</li>
  <li>&#9199 Start Vtracker.exe</li>
  <li>&#9199 Start your browser and log into the vtracker using localhost: yourport or "your_ip": yourport</li>
  <li>&#9989 After the configuration, send the url to the drivers. At the end of each session, the timetable will be updated</li>
</ul>
<h3>Installation on Linux:</h3>
<ul>
  <li>&#127758 Download the wine packages for linux. The <b>wine development package</b> is recommended as it is required by the ACC server</li>
  <li>&#127758 Download the tar.gz and extract it in a folder of your choice</li>
  <li>&#128736 Open the "config.json" file and enter the file path of the results folder</li>
  <li>&#9199 Start the application using wine ./Vtracker.exe</li>
  <li>&#9199 Start your browser and log into the vtracker using localhost: 9000 or "your_ip": 9000</li>
  <li>&#9989 After the configuration, send the url to the drivers. At the end of each session, the timetable will be updated</li>
  <li>NOTE: The vtracker can also be run in the background on VPS</li>
</ul>
